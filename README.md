=================

This is a sample Vite React app that you can use as a starting point for your own projects.

Installation
------------

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory:

To start the development server, run the following command:

This will start the development server using Vite and open your app in the default browser. Any changes you make to the code will automatically reload the app in the browser.

To build your app for production, run the following command:

This will build your app and output the static files to the `dist` directory.
